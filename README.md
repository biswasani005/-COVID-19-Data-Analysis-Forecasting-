[COVID-19 Analysis]([https://chatgpt.com/s/m_68cc429bd774819195ee4b26b46d02a0]()


## 📌 Project Overview  
The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact globally.  
This project analyzes COVID-19 infection and recovery trends using **Python**, provides interactive visualizations, and applies **time series forecasting** to predict future case counts.  

It demonstrates how data science can be used for real-world crisis analysis and prediction**.  

🔑 Key Steps in the Project  
- Data Collection & Processing:  
  Used **Pandas** to accumulate and clean data from CSV and Excel files.  

- Interactive Visualizations: 
  Created dashboards using **Plotly** to show confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different regions.  

- Time Series Forecasting: 
  Applied Facebook Prophet to model and predict COVID-19 case trends.  

- Comparison & Insights: 
  Compared global vs India-specific data, highlighting infection spikes and recovery trends.  


## 🏗️ Methodology  
1. Loaded and cleaned the datasets (global & India COVID-19 data).  
2. Created visualizations for daily and cumulative confirmed, recovered, and death counts.  
3. Used Facebook Prophet to make short-term forecasts (7+ days ahead).  
4. Visualized predictions alongside actual case counts.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Plotly (interactive dashboards)  
- Facebook Prophet (time series forecasting)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (static visualizations)

  
## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Predicted the rise in case numbers with reasonable accuracy.  
- Identified peak periods of infections and recovery patterns.  
- Demonstrated the usefulness of **time series forecasting in healthcare analytics**.
